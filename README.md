Project Overview:

This repository contains the source code for a web-based visualization of a singly linked list data structure. The application allows users to create, manipulate, and visualize singly linked lists through an interactive interface.

Features:

Node Creation: Users can add nodes to the end of the linked list by entering a value.
Node Insertion: Users can insert nodes at a specific position within the linked list.
Node Deletion: Users can remove the last node from the linked list or delete a node based on its value.
Node Search: Users can search for a node within the linked list based on its value.
List Reversal: Users can reverse the order of the nodes in the linked list.
List Clearing: Users can clear all nodes from the linked list.
Visual Representation: The linked list is visually represented on the web page, allowing users to observe the changes made to the data structure.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
CSS: Styles the visual appearance of the website elements.
JavaScript: Handles user interactions, data structure manipulations, and visual updates.
Getting Started:

Clone the Repository:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/ristonrodrigues723/singly-linked-list-visualization.git
Use code with caution.

Open in a Web Browser: Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
Usage:

Enter Values: Use the input fields to enter the value and position for nodes to be added or inserted.
Perform Operations: Click the buttons to add, insert, remove, delete, search, reverse, or clear the linked list.
Visualize Changes: The linked list visualization will update in real-time to reflect the changes made.
